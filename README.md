## ChartIMDB
Makes a chart of an IMDB TV series ratings episode by episode. The input needed is either the URL to the series main page (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt...../) or just the "ID" (tt....).

Currently the script only makes the chart and calculates the episodes median, but hopefully it should do more things on the future.

## Conversor
A simple command line conversor between decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary. See file for usage.
